# texture-sampling

Render a TGA image through GPU with metal framework. Instead of default Objective-C, I have used rust binding for metal framework (https://github.com/gfx-rs/metal-rs) and metal shading program to render the TGA image (Texture). Follow this fine documentation for more details https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/creating_and_sampling_textures .
